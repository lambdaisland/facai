;; Let's define our first factory. You pass it a template of what your data

;; We can generate data from this template by calling the factory as a function,
;; which is an alias for calling `f/build-val`

(user) ; or (f/build-val user)
;; => #:user{:name "Lilliam Predovic",
;;           :handle "lilli42",
;;           :email "lilli42@example.com"}

;; It can take a few options, use `:with` to override or supply additional
;; values.
